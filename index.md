# This is my first header. 

## This one is slightly smaller
### and subheader to that
### and one more

## And a second slightly smaller one

#### h4
##### h5
###### h6


I added a variety of different headers


Now I'll add an image:

Now I'll add code:

```elixir
myVariable = [a, b, c]

myVariable
|> enum
```
